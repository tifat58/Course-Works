Which kind of filter is it? Is it a low- or high-pass filter?
The pre-emphasis filter is a high-pass filter.

Task 1.2:
How many frames can be produced from k samples?
depending on the value of `shift', k/shift frames
can be produced in total.

Task 1.3:
Could you see some similarities?
The spectogram, though barely visible, highlights the same spots
as the visible peaks from the original audiostream waveform, as in
where the words are spoken in the audio.

Task 1.5:
Could you see some similarities?
The highlighted spots are the same as from the spectogram itself,
but they seem to have become larger.
But still, they are only barely visible.

Task 2.1:
see the implementation in linear_fit.m
